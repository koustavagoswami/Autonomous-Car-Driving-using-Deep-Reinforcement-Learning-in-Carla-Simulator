# Autonomous-Car-Driving-using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-in-Carla-Simulator
The code has been implemented in Carla Simulator with the help of Double DQN to train an agent how to drive autonomously using different architecture. To train the agent in command line pass the parameter "Train" and after training to test how the agent is behaving pass "Run" as parameter
